        <h2>The Red Wheelbarrow</h2>
        <p>So much depends upon</p>
        <p>A red Wheelbarrow</p>
        <p>Glazed with rain water</p>
        <p>Beside the white chickens.</p>
        <h3> The Bare Tree</h3>
        <p>The bare cherry tree</p>
        <p>higher than the roof</p>
        <p>last year prouced</p>
        <p>abundant fruit. But how</p>
        <p>speak of fruit confronted</p>
        <p>by that skeleton?</p>
        <p>Though live it may be</p>
        <p>theres is no fruit on it.</p>
        <p>Therefore chop it down</p>
        <p>and use the wood</p>
        <p>against this biting cold</p>
        <h4>This Is Just To Say</h4>
        <p>I have eaten</p>
        <p>the plums</p>
        <p>that were in</p>
        <p>the ice box</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>and wich</p>
        <p>you were probably</p>
        <p>saving</p>
        <p>for breakfast</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Forgive me</p>
        <p>they were delicious</p>
        <p>so sweet</p>
        <p>and so cold</p>
